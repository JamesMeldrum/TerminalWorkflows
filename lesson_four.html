<h4>Introduction</h4><br /><br />
<center><img src="/TerminalWorkflows/img/dying_bash.jpg" height="300px" /></center><br />
<p>I hear a lot that shell scripting is a dying art. Whilst it may be possible to do anything in shell in another language, it is hard to find a tool that will let you develop filesystem operations as quickly as a simple bash script. In Python, to view the contents of the home directory its an operation that requires specific calls on the os module and you'll need to hand-format the output after iterating the output. In bash, its 2 lines.</p><br />
<hr/>
<p>
#!/bin/bash<br />
# list.sh<br />
echo `ls`<br />
</p>
<hr/>
<p>
#!/env python<br />
# list.py<br />
import os<br />
def list_dirs():<br />
  path = "/home/jrm"<br />
  dirList = os.listdir(path)<br />
  for fname in dirList:<br />
    print fname<br />
<br />
if __name__ == "__main__":<br />
  list_dirs()<br />
</p>
<hr/>
<br />
<p>I wish to make clear that I'm not saying that bash is the highlander of programming languages, it has specific use cases that cannot be easily replicated.</p>
