<h4>Introduction</h4><br /><br />
<p>tmux is a "terminal multiplexer", it enables a number of terminals (or windows) to be accessed and controlled from a single terminal. tmux is intended to be a simple, modern, BSD-licensed alternative to programs such as GNU screen.</p><br /><br />
<p>Vim is  a  text  editor that is upwards compatible to Vi.  It can be used to edit all kinds of plain text.  It is especially useful for editing programs. There are a lot of enhancements above Vi: multi level undo, multi windows and  buffers,  syntax highlighting,  command line editing, filename completion, on-line help, visual selection. There is no longer any point to using Viso we'll just restrict this presentation to Vim.</p>

<!--Record and playback commands

The "." command repeats the preceding change.  But what if you want to do
something more complex than a single change?  That's where command recording
comes in.  There are three steps:

1. The "q{register}" command starts recording keystrokes into the register
   named {register}.  The register name must be between a and z.
2. Type your commands.
3. To finish recording, press q (without any extra character).

You can now execute the macro by typing the command "@{register}".

Take a look at how to use these commands in practice.  You have a list of
filenames that look like this:

        stdio.h
        fcntl.h
        unistd.h
        stdlib.h

And what you want is the following:

        #include "stdio.h"
        #include "fcntl.h"
        #include "unistd.h"
        #include "stdlib.h"

You start by moving to the first character of the first line.  Next you
execute the following commands:

        qa                      Start recording a macro in register a.
        ^                       Move to the beginning of the line.
        i#include "<Esc>        Insert the string #include " at the beginning
                                of the line.
        $                       Move to the end of the line.
        a"<Esc>                 Append the character double quotation mark (")
                                to the end of the line.
        j                       Go to the next line.
        q                       Stop recording the macro.

Now that you have done the work once, you can repeat the change by typing the
command "@a" three times.
   The "@a" command can be preceded by a count, which will cause the macro to
be executed that number of times.  In this case you would type: >

        3@a
        -->
<h4>Vim abbreviations</h4><br /><br />
<!--
FIXING TYPING MISTAKES

It's very common to make the same typing mistake every time.  For example,
typing "teh" instead of "the".  You can fix this with an abbreviation: >

        :abbreviate teh the

You can add a whole list of these.  Add one each time you discover a common
mistake.


LISTING ABBREVIATIONS

The ":abbreviate" command lists the abbreviations:

        :abbreviate
        i  #e             ****************************************/
        i  #b            /****************************************
        i  JB            Jack Benny
        i  ad            advertisement
        !  teh           the

The "i" in the first column indicates Insert mode.  These abbreviations are
only active in Insert mode.  Other possible characters are:

        c       Command-line mode                       :cabbrev
        !       both Insert and Command-line mode       :abbreviate

Since abbreviations are not often useful in Command-line mode, you will mostly
use the ":iabbrev" command.  That avoids, for example, that "ad" gets expanded
when typing a command like: >

        :edit ad


DELETING ABBREVIATIONS

To get rid of an abbreviation, use the ":unabbreviate" command.  Suppose you
have the following abbreviation: >

        :abbreviate @f fresh

You can remove it with this command: >

:unabbreviate @f-->
